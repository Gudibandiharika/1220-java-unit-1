Java Features of Java..

The features of Java are also known as Java buzzwords.

1. Simple
2. Oject-oriented 
3. Portable
4. Platform independent
5. Secured
6. Robust
7. Architecture neutral 
8. Interpreted.
9. High performance 
10.Multithreaded
11.Distributed
12.Dynamic
--------------------------------------------------------------
1.Simple : *Easy to learn
	   *Simple syntax
           *Easy understabd syntax based on c++
           *Overloading
           *No need to remove unreferenced objects at automatic garbafe collecion in java.
2.Object-oriented : *Everything in java is an object
		    *OOP means we organize our software as a combination of data & behaviour.
3.Portable : It facilitates you to carry the java bytecode to any platform.
4.Platform independent : Java provides a software-based platform
				Two Components...
				i)Runtime, ii)API(Application programming Interface).
                         Ex:- Linux, window, Sun Solaris, Maclos etc.

5.Secured:  * No explicit pointer 
            * Java programs run inside a vm sandbox
	    * Class leader.
	    * Bytcode verifier
	    * Security Manage.

6.Robust:   *Strong memory management.
	    *Lack of pointers that avoids security problems.
	    *Automatic garbage collection in java not used in java application.
	    *Exception handling.
7. Architecture neutral: There are no implementation dependent features. 
				 ex:- the size of primitive typesis fixed.

8. Interpreted : Converts source code is first compiled into a binary byte-code.
9. High performance: Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming language because java bytecode is "close" to native code.
10.Multithreaded: Execute concurrently doing many tasks at once by defining multiple threads.
			*Share common memory area.
			*Threads are important for multi-media, web applications.
11.Distributed: RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications.
12.Dynamic: *Classes are loaded on demand and functions from its native language.
	    *Supports dynamic compilation.
